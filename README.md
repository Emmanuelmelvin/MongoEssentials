## Introduction

MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database known for its flexibility, scalability, and ease of use. MongoDB Atlas is a cloud-based database service that simplifies deployment and management of MongoDB clusters. This project will help you get started with both.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node package manager)
- A MongoDB Atlas account (you can sign up for a free tier [here](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas))

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mongodb-basics-nodejs.git
    cd mongodb-basics-nodejs
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your MongoDB connection string:
    ```
    MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string
    ```

2. You can get your connection string from the MongoDB Atlas dashboard. Make sure to replace `your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string` with your actual connection string.

## Usage

1. To start the application, run:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

2. You can also use nodemon for automatic restarts during development:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Set up a Node.js project with MongoDB as the database
- Connect to a MongoDB instance hosted on MongoDB Atlas
- Perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
- Understand the basics of MongoDB schemas and models
- Use environment variables to manage configuration
